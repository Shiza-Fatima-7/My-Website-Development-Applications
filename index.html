    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard 
    backbone used to create and structure content on the 
    World Wide Web. Rather than a programming language 
    that handles logic, HTML is a markup language; it 
    uses a system of "tags" to tell a web browser how 
    to display text, images, and interactive forms.       
    HTML was conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, 
    a physicist at CERN (the European Organization for
    Nuclear Research). At the time, researchers 
    struggled to share information across different 
    computer systems. Berners-Lee envisioned a "web"
    of interconnected documents that could be accessed 
    from any terminal.HTML works through a tree-like 
    hierarchy of elements. An author wraps content in
    tags, such as <h1> for a main heading or <p> for a paragraph. 
    These tags are invisible to the user but provide
    the browser with a roadmap. Today, HTML5 is the current standard,
    maintained by the W3C and WHATWG. It has evolved 
    from a simple text-sharing tool into a robust
    platform capable of powering complex web 
    applications, ensuring that the original dream of
    a globally connected information space 
    remains a reality.ss
