    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>

    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML, or <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, is the standard language
        used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.
        It is not a programming language but a markup language that
        uses tags to tell a web browser how to display text, images,
        and forms.
    </p>

    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML was conceived in <b>1989</b> by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a physicist
        at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). At that time,
        researchers faced difficulties in sharing information across
        different computer systems.
    </p>

    <h2>How HTML Works</h2>
    <p>
        HTML works through a tree-like hierarchy of elements. Content
        is wrapped inside tags such as <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> for headings and
        <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> for paragraphs. These tags guide the browser on
        how to display the content.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern HTML</h2>
    <p>
        Today, <b>HTML5</b> is the current standard maintained by the W3C
        and WHATWG. It has evolved from a simple text-sharing tool into
        a powerful platform capable of supporting modern web applications.
